## Trigger CRR on objects that were put before replication was enabled on the bucket

1. Enable versioning and setup replication on the bucket
2. Run script as
```
node crrExistingObjects.js testbucket1,testbucket2
```

# Empty a versioned bucket

This script deletes all versions of objects in the bucket including delete markers,
and aborts any ongoing multipart uploads to prepare the bucket for deletion.

**Note: This will delete data associated with the objects and it's not recoverable**
```
node cleanupBuckets.js testbucket1,testbucket2
```

# List objects that failed replication

This script can print the list of objects that failed replication to stdout by
taking a comma-separated list of buckets. Run the command as

````
node listFailedObjects testbucket1, testbucket2
```
